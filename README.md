# Lexical-analyzer

Built a lexical analyzer for the Jack programming language using the ply python library. The lexical analyzer scans the source code file and determines the classification of the token based on Regular Expressions defined within the program. The lexical analyzer prompts the user for a file path to the .Jack file and prints the tokenized file in Xml format to the console.
